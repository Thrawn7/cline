[[Change From Protest]], [[Inspiration for Change]]


(born **Malcolm Little** ; May 19, 1925 – February 21, 1965)
Malcolm was a influential figure that had more violent views than [[Martin Luther King Jr]] but still wanted the same goal of equal rights and access. He was quoted saying “It's just like when you've got some coffee that's too black, which means it's too strong. What do you do? You integrate it with cream, you make it weak. But if you pour too much cream in it, you won't even know you ever had coffee. It used to be hot, it becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to wake you up, now it puts you to sleep (Malcolm X)" in response to MLK's Peaceful Protests. He was also a part of the [[Black Panthers ]]Because they believed in a more militant radical version of change.
